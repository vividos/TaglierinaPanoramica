The app helps to split a panorama image into several images to use them in
fancy Instagram posts. The app name came into my mind while learning some
italian on Duolingo.

## Development

Most of the code for cropping images was taken from the SkiaSharp examples
found here:

https://github.com/dotnet/maui-samples/blob/main/8.0/SkiaSharp/SkiaSharpDemos/SkiaSharpDemos/Bitmaps/PhotoCropperCanvasView.cs

The rest is a fairly standard .NET MAUI app, using some external libraries
to keep code low.

Builds are done using GitHub actions:

The app is licensed using the [Apache License 2.0](LICENSE), the same license
